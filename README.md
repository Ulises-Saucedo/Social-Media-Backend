## Install project

```
pnpm i
```

## Documentation

Import doc.json to postman to see the different endpoints and create the uploads/avatars and uploads/publications directories:

```
root
│
└───uploads
│   │
│   └───avatars
│   │   │   avatar-images
│   │
│   └───publications
│   │   │   publication-images

```
Finally open the .env.dist file and change its extension only to .env, and then configure its SECRET_KEY.
